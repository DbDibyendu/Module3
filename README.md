## How to complete the Module?
Learning a skill happes in 3 stages Understand, Summarize & Practice (USP). This applies to the module as well.

| Process Stage | Description                                                                        | Links      |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|
| Understand    | Read course material and try to understand topics covered in the Module.           | [Wiki](https://gitlab.iotiot.in/newbies/iot-internship-feb-20/module3/wikis/home)   |
| Summarize (Assignment)     | Reinforce critical parts of the subject by writing them down in concise Summaries. | [Issues](https://gitlab.iotiot.in/newbies/iot-internship-feb-20/module3/issues) |
| Practice  (Assignment)    | Practice skills, to make your learning. This where your brain learns the most.     | [Issues](https://gitlab.iotiot.in/newbies/iot-internship-feb-20/module3/issues) |

Last Step is to **Submit** your Summary and Practice Assignment in the [Issue](https://gitlab.iotiot.in/newbies/iot-internship-feb-20/module3/issues)
