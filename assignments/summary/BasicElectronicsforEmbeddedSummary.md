# Basics Electronics for Embedded
**Embedded** means something that is attached to another thing. An embedded system can be thought of as a computer hardware system having software embedded in it. An embedded system can be an independent system or it can be a part of a large system. It offers many benefits such as sophisticated control, precision timing, low unit cost, low development cost, high flexibility, small size, and low weight. These basic characteristics can be used to improve the overall system or device in various ways:     
• **Improved performance**         
• **More functions and features**   
• **Reduced cost**   
• **Increased dependability**
