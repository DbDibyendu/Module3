# Do's And Dont's in General
| **Do's** | **Dont's** |
| ------ | ------ |
| Always make sure that the output voltage of the power supply matches the input voltage of the board. | Never connect a higher output(12V/3Amp) to a lower (5V/2Amp) input . |
| While turning on the power supply make sure every circuit is **connected properly**. | Do not connect power supply without matching the power rating. | 
|Unplug the device before performing any operation on them.|Donâ€™t handle the board when its **powered ON** or When the **device** is running |
|When handling electrical equipment, make sure your **hands are dry**.| Never touch electrical equipment when any part of your body is wet, (that includes fair amounts of perspiration). |
|Find out whether the board runs on **3.3v or 5v logic**.|Never connect anything greater that 5v to a 3.3v pin. |
|Always connect the LED (or sensors) using appropriate **resistors** .|Do not connect a motor directly , use a **transistor** to drive it .|
