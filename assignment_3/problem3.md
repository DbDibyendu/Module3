# Problem 3

### Goal : Write code for driving Stepper Motors using Shunya Interfaces on Raspberry Pi 4

### Description

Please use Stepper motor library as reference. 

- [Stepper motor library](https://crish4cks.net/a-simple-c-library-to-drive-a-stepper-motor-using-the-raspberry-pi/)

This stepper motor library is written using Wiring Pi API, Convert Wiring Pi 
API's into Shunya Interfaces API's for Stepper Motor library. 
Write code to drive Stepper Motors with RPI 4 over using GPIO.


### For Example: 

Lets say 
#### Given (Input)
that the  Stepper Motor is connected to the RPI4 over GPIO, the example code when run
#### Then (output)
should loop and move the Stepper motor by 360 deg each iteration of the loop in 
forward direction with a delay of 30 ms every loop.


### Acceptance Criteria 
This is the criteria to accept the assignment.
- The code must be divided into functions 
- **Must** have documentation for using the program.
- Code **Must** follow the Coding Standards.
- Code can be either in C or in CPP.

#### Note: Documentation of the whole program is a must criteria for the completion of the Assignment.
