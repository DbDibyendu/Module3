# Problem 2

### Goal : Write code for driving Servo Motors using Shunya Interfaces on Raspberry Pi 4

### Description

Please use the link as reference. 

- [Servo on RPI](https://rpi.science.uoit.ca/lab/servo/)

Use the logic/formula's given in the link above and use Shunya Interfaces PWM API
to drive Servo Motors on RPI4. 

Write code to drive Servo Motors with RPI 4 over using GPIO and generate 0 - 180 deg
circular motion using the formula from the link and Shunya Interfaces API's.


### For Example: 

Lets say 
#### Given (Input)
that the  Servo Motor is connected to the RPI4 over GPIO, the example code when run
#### Then (output)
should loop and move the servo motor by 1 deg each iteration of the loop with 
a delay of 30 ms every loop.


### Acceptance Criteria 
This is the criteria to accept the assignment.
- The code must be divided into functions 
- **Must** have documentation for using the program.
- Code **Must** follow the Coding Standards.
- Code can be either in C or in CPP.

#### Note: Documentation of the whole program is a must criteria for the completion of the Assignment.
